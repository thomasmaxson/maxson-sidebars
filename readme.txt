== Technical Support ==

Dear users, my plugins are available for free download. If you have any questions or recommendations regarding the functionality of my plugins (existing options, new options, current issues), please feel free to contact me. Please note that I accept requests in English only. All messages in another languages won't be accepted.

If you notice any bugs in the plugins, you can notify me about it and I'll investigate and address the issue accordingly. Your request should contain URL of the website, issues description and WordPress admin panel credentials.

Moreover I can customize the plugin according to your requirements. It's a paid service (as a rule it costs $75/hour, but the price can vary depending on the amount of the necessary changes and their complexity). Please note that I could also include this or that feature (developed for you) in the next release and share with the other users then.

I can fix some things for free for the users who provide translation of my plugin into their native language (this should be a new translation of a this plugin, you can check available translations on the official plugin page).
